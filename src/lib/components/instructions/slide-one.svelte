		I invite you to discover the space oddity rules. A very simple and ideal card game to have a
		good time with friends in a relaxed and spacey atmosphere. To win this game, all you have to do
		is run out of cards at the end of the game, so there can be several winners, but only one loser.
	</p>
	<p>
		we're not going to lie to each other, no one wants to get sucked into a black hole and lose,
		however, beyond its name, this very funny card game is easy to organize during an evening with
		friends.

		Which one of you will be the last to have the black hole card?
