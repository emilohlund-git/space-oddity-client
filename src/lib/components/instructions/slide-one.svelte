		I invite you to discover the Space Oddity rules, a very simple and enjoyable card game to play
		with friends in a relaxed and spacey atmosphere. The objective of the game is to run out of
		cards at the end, so there can be multiple winners, but only one loser.
	</p>
	<p>
		we're not going to lie to each other, no one wants to get sucked into a black hole and lose,
		however, beyond its name, this very funny card game is easy to organize during an evening with
		friends.
	</p>
	<p class="text-[#00BAFF] font-bold">
		Which one of you will be the last to have the black hole card?
