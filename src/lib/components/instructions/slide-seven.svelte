		The -Space Oddity- being a game of chance, there's not any particular technique to increase your
		chances of winning. On the other hand, players with the 'Black Hole' card often have fun
		bluffing by highlighting a card from their deck to stir up trouble for whoever has to draw:
		Either this card is indeed the 'Black Hole' card, in which case it should not be grabbed, or if
		it is not, that means that the 'Black Hole' card is one of the other cards presented.
