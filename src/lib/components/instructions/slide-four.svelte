		- Goal: Get rid of all your cards to win. The last player holding the "black hole" card loses.
	</p>
	<p>
		- Dealing: Every player starts with three cards, if amount of players is not divisible by three,
		one player will have 1 less cards than everyone else. The player with the least amount of cards
		starts.
