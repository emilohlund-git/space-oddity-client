		The player with one card less than the others begins the game by drawing a card from his
		neighbor on the left, without showing it to uninvolved players. If this allows the player to
		form a new pair, then he discards them immediately. It is then the neighbors turn to draw,
		always from the person to his left. The game continues in this way until all the pairs have been
		formed and there is only one card left, the black hole one.
	</p>
	<p class="text-red-600 font-bold">- Game over</p>
	<p>
		Players who have no more cards wins and no longer play. The player with the last card in hand,
		the red black hole ring, loses. The other players can give him a token.
