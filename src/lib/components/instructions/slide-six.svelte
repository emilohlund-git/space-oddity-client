	<p>
		The player with one card less than the others begins by drawing a card from the deck, or their
		neighbor (if the deck is empty) on the left without showing it to other players. If this allows
		the player to form a new pair, they immediately discard the pair. The turn then passes to the
		neighbor on the left, and the game continues in this manner until all pairs are formed, leaving
		only one card remaining, the black hole card.
	</p>
	<p class="text-red-600 font-bold">Game over</p>
	<p>
		Players who have no more cards wins and no longer play. The player with the last card in hand,
		the red black hole ring, loses. The other players can give him a token.
